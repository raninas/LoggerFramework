# Logger Framework
This goal of this project is to teach-by-example quite a few software architecture and design principles. The code is written in C# a language that is very similar to Java, and, like Java, has its syntax rooted in C.

Although you can compile the code by hand as long as you have the [.Net Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) installed, I recommend you compile using [Visual Studio 2019 Express Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

Because it is .NET Core, this code runs on MAC, Linux, and Windows. There is also a version of VS 2019 Express for all three platforms.
